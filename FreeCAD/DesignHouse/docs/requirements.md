# Beach House Requirements (Draft)

Capture what you specify here; keep it source-controlled and updated as decisions change. Use concise bullets; add IDs if helpful.

## Objectives
- TBD (e.g., resilient beach house, X bedrooms/baths, outdoor living, flood-resistant structure).

## Site & Environmental
- Location/climate: 950 Surf Rd, Crystal Beach, TX 77650 (coastal Gulf; hot-humid)
- Wind/flood/snow/seismic design criteria: TBD (codes, design speeds, flood zone/DFE/BFE)
- Soil/foundation constraints: TBD
- Site reference frame: model lot in +X/+Y with origin at southwest (bottom-left) corner; lot extents to (50', 100'); setback on 50' side is 5' (buildable width 40'); front (road) setback 20' along Y (buildable length 80').

## Program & Layout
- Footprint, stories, target square footage: maximize 40' width (50' lot with 5' setback on 50' side), lot 50'x100'; stories TBD
- Room counts (beds/baths/utility), decks/porches: TBD
- Accessibility considerations: TBD

## Structural
- Framing system (wood/steel/CMU), floor/roof framing schemes: TBD
- Roof type/pitch, overhangs: TBD
- Connections/fasteners, uplift detailing: TBD
- Service chases/penetrations reserves: TBD
- Piers: 12"x12" PT, extend ~17' above grade to bottom of joist framing; embed depth TBD.
- Beams at piers: double 2x12s bearing in pier notches, blocking between plies to maintain spacing.
- Beach piles: square 12"x12" treated piles, assume 40' total (20' embed, 20' above grade to bearing) — based on American Pole & Timber supply.
- Pier grid intent: X direction 6 piers evenly spaced across 40' buildable width (centers at edges). Y direction: rows aligned to 16' beam lengths so beam splices land mid-pier; start at front setback (Y=20') and place rows every 16' (20', 36', 52', 68', 84') to cover a 64' run with 4×16' beams.
- Elevation datum: Z=0 at finished grade; piles extend to Z=-20' (embed) and up to ~Z=+20' bearing elevation.

## Envelope
- Wall/roof assemblies, insulation targets (R-values/U-factors): TBD
- Windows/doors performance and placement: TBD
- Moisture control, corrosion resistance (coastal): TBD

## MEP & Appliances
- HVAC type/ducting zones: TBD
- Plumbing fixtures, hot water strategy: TBD
- Electrical service size, circuits, EV/solar readiness: TBD
- Appliance list/locations: TBD

## Codes & Standards
- Building code edition (IBC/IRC), local amendments: TBD
- Floodplain requirements (FEMA/ASCE 24): TBD
- Energy code: TBD

## Automation & Robotics (Future)
- Construction automation scope (future): TBD
- Sensor/monitoring provisions: TBD

## Constraints & Assumptions
- Budget/schedule constraints: TBD
- Material availability (lumber sizes, coatings): TBD
- Assumptions to validate: TBD
