# Beach House Decisions Log

Use lightweight entries (date, decision, rationale). Update as choices are made.

- TBD — first decision goes here.
- Coord system: Lot modeled in +X/+Y with origin at southwest corner; lot extents 50' (X) by 100' (Y); 5' setback on 50' side → buildable width 40'.
- Build routing: `FreeCAD/run_build_house.sh` with `BUILD_TARGET=beach` or `BEACH_LOT=1` invokes `BeachHouse/run_beach_house.sh` to generate 950 Surf lot (`FreeCAD/builds/950Surf.<timestamp>.fcstd`); default target remains lumber build.
- Lot setbacks: 5' on the 50' side (width), 20' front (road) setback along Y; buildable envelope is 40' wide by 80' deep (from Y=20' to Y=100').
- Pile spec: square 12"x12" treated piles, assume 40' total (20' embed, 20' above grade to bearing); supplier reference: American Pole & Timber.
- Pile grid: 6 piers along X evenly spaced across 40' buildable width (centers at edges); Y rows on 16' increments starting at Y=20' (front setback): 20', 36', 52', 68', 84' to support four 16' beams with splices at pier centers.
- Elevation: Z=0 at finished grade; piles modeled down to Z=-20' embed and up to Z=+20' bearing.
- **2025-12-20**: Plumbing drain routing relocated to align with stair module at Floor_Middle_Right_16x8. Stub-up now at east face of pile 4,5 (X=33.635', Y=52.46875'). North-south "home run" positioned in middle of pile gap (X=37.0', between pile columns 4 and 5) to avoid alignment issues. Septic tank repositioned to X=37.0' (centered on north-south run) for direct connection. Routing sequence: (1) stub-up at pile east face, (2) horizontal east to gap middle, (3) vertical drop at gap, (4) straight north to tank inlet. This design eliminates turns, simplifies construction, and ensures stair module accessibility.
- **2025-12-20**: Water service relocated to pile 5,4 west face (X=40.49', Y=44.46875'), routes WEST to gap middle at X=37.0', then south to street. Electrical service at pile 4,4 east face (X=33.51', Y=44.96875'), routes EAST to gap middle at X=37.0', then south to street. Both use north-south "home run" at X=37.0' in pile gap. Water: 1" PVC at 42" depth (IRC P2603.6). Electrical: 2.5" Schedule 40 PVC conduit at 24" depth for 200A service (NEC 310.12, NEC 300.5). This separation allows future propane/natural gas service at another corner.
- **2025-12-20**: Added electrical infrastructure modeling, stacked vertically at pile 4,4 (X=33.51', Y=44.96875'): meter box (200A, 14"W×28"H×5"D, bottom at 48" above slab), disconnect switch (200A, 12"W×20"H×6"D, stacked above meter with 2" gap, bottom at 78" per NEC 230.70), and main panel (200A 40-circuit load center, 17.5"W×42"H×4.5"D, stacked above disconnect with 2" gap, bottom at 100", temporary location - will relocate to house interior per NEC 110.26). Service routing: street → underground 2.5" conduit → stub-up at pile 4,4 → meter → disconnect → panel.
