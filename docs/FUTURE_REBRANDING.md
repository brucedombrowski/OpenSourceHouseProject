# Future Rebranding: Open Source Project Management System

## Overview
The current "Open Source House Project" (OSHP) application is fundamentally a generic **Open Source Project Management System** that happens to be configured for residential construction projects. This insight has significant implications for the project's future direction.

## Current State (House Project)
- WBS (Work Breakdown Structure) management
- Gantt chart scheduling
- Kanban board for task management
- Project item tracking (issues, tasks, enhancements, risks, decisions)
- Resource allocation
- Progress tracking and reporting

## Future Vision (Generic OSPM)
The system could be rebranded and generalized to serve any project type:
- Software development projects
- Construction projects (current use case)
- Product launches
- Event planning
- Research initiatives
- Any project requiring hierarchical task management and scheduling

## Key Requirements for Rebranding
1. **Generic terminology** - Replace "House Project" with "Project Management System"
2. **Configurable project types** - Make construction-specific features optional/pluggable
3. **Template library** - Pre-configured WBS templates for different industries
4. **Generic theming** - Move away from construction-specific UI elements
5. **Documentation** - Create guides for setting up projects in different domains

## Benefits of this Approach
- ✅ Broader market appeal
- ✅ Community contributions from multiple domains
- ✅ More sustainable open source project
- ✅ Faster feature development (larger user base)
- ✅ Better potential for sponsorship/funding

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Core system working with house project template
- Landing page and navigation completed
- ✅ Completed: 2025-12-07

### Phase 2: Generalization (Future)
- Remove construction-specific assumptions
- Create configuration system for project templates
- Update documentation and branding
- **Estimated effort**: 40-60 hours

### Phase 3: Marketplace (Long-term)
- Community template library
- Plugin system for domain-specific features
- Commercial hosting option

## Notes
- Current database schema is already generic enough to support multiple project types
- WBS structure is domain-agnostic
- Main work is UI/UX and documentation updates
- Consider name change: "OpenProM" or "OSPM" (Open Source Project Manager)
