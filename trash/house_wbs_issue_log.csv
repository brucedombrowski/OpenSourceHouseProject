1,WBS renumbering inconsistent / confusing in admin UI,"Renumbering WBS codes works from CLI but behavior in admin UI is confusing. Dragging top-level items can trigger MPTT InvalidMove errors, and updated codes are not always obvious in the tree view. Needs a more robust and predictable renumber strategy plus clearer feedback in admin.",Open,Medium,Admin UI / Renumbering / MPTT,2025-12-05,Bruce,Avoid aggressive drag/drop of root nodes; rely on CLI renumber_wbs; rebuild tree if MPTT becomes unstable.,Logged after debugging session where InvalidMove was seen when moving root nodes.
2,Gantt timeline labels hard to read / scroll UX,"Gantt chart horizontal timeline dates render correctly but labels become dense and hard to read on longer schedules. Horizontal scrollbar is only easily accessible at the bottom of the page, making navigation awkward for large charts.",Open,Medium,Gantt Chart / Scheduling UI,2025-12-05,Bruce,None; zoom browser or limit date range to inspect sections.,Planned fix: adaptive tick spacing (weekly/bi-weekly/monthly), rotated labels for readability, and a dedicated scroll container so the horizontal scrollbar is always visible within the Gantt area.
